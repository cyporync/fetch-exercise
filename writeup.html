                <p class="text-purple-100 text-lg mb-4">In this exercise, I used Copilot with GPT-5 mini and Claude
                    Haiku 4.5. From my experiences using both models in this exercise, I found that GPT-5 mini was more
                    useful for fetching JSON data from the endpoints and Claude Haiku 4.5 was more useful for styling
                    the site. I set up the initial endpoints. Then, I prompted Claude to change the endpoints to
                    retrieve both the quote name and author name from a random quote. Claude struggled with this, and
                    its solution did not work. GPT-5 mini was able to complete the task given a similar prompt. Using AI
                    was slightly helpful, but I could've done this myself without the hassle of prompting the different
                    models. I've never used Claude, and Claude Haiku 4.5 was far superior at styling than any LLM I've
                    used before. I was very impressed with the design it came up with. The first styling prompt I gave
                    was very minimal: "Create a style.css file and style this site using Tailwind CSS. Make it look
                    pretty." It created a nice design, and it was easy to tweak things I wanted changed with a few more
                    prompts. It would've taken forever for me to style this myself with Tailwind. I found it very useful
                    for this purpose.</p>
